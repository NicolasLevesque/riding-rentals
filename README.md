# Riding Rentals 🏠📍

A rental search tool that filters apartment listings based on Canadian political ridings.

## Features

- Input any federal riding (e.g. `Carleton`)
- Pulls rental listings from platforms using mapped postal prefixes
- Filters by price and parking
- Optional monetization logic for future upgrade tiers

## Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests)
